# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project as a way to both practice the basics of web development and house information learned during the Prework section of the SMU Coding Bootcamp. This creates an organized way to see a lot of new information for a beginning coding student. I learned the core principles of designing a web application, including the core languages, their syntax, and best practices. I also got a lot of practice using Git and building a good Git flow habit.
